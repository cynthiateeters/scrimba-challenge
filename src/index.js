it would in real life. Using the pre-made dice face that represents â€˜oneâ€™, make the 
faces for â€˜twoâ€™, â€˜threeâ€™, â€˜fourâ€™, â€˜fiveâ€™ and â€˜sixâ€™. Now when the users clicks the 
dice on the screen the dice is expected to show one of the faces randomly.

  console.log(`random num is ${idx}`);
  h1.innerText = `You Rolled a ${idx}`;
